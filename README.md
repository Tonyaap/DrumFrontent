Goals for this project

---

After going through a though and intensive (but super fun!) coding bootcamp of 9 weeks it's time to put what i've learned to the test. The goal for this project was to build a full-stack-app and explore (for me) new technologies. Lot's of reading forums, watching videos and trial and error.

- Practice full-stack app development
- Build a working prototype in 2 weeks
- Apply the things i've learned in the bootcamp
- Learn and use the Tone.Js library
- Practice development skills like:

  - Making wireframes
  - Data model design
  - Write user stories
  - Use git version control

  User Stories

  ***

  - As a visitor of Drum_Machine, I am able to sign up and log in as a user. I must register before I can save my compositions
  - The compositions I made can be saved by giving them a name
  - I can see compositions I've saved in the past and load them so I can listen to them again
  - I am able to play around with the sounds, adjust speed, volume and use Effects.
  - Planned: Share your compositions with other users,
  - Planned: Change Individual sounds.

The project is still in progess and I'm planning to improve and add features over time. Any suggestions or feedback?
Please let me know!
