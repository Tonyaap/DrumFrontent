## What this app is about

Click [here](URL HERE) for a working version

Drum_Machine is about expressing your musical creativity in your web-browser!
This app allows users to create and save beats.
for the sounds i've used one of the most iconic drum computers of all time, the legendary roland-808.

## APP DEMO

GIF OF USING THE APP

---

## Used technologies and concepts

- React for UI building
- Redux for state management
- Authentication
- Express as web app framework
- AWS S3 for hosting audio files
- Sequelize as ORM
- ToneJs library as DAW (digital audio workstation)

## Goals for this project

---

After going through a though and intensive (but super fun!) coding bootcamp of 9 weeks it's time to put what i've learned to the test. The goal for this project was to build a full-stack-app and explore (for me) new technologies. Lot's of reading forums, watching videos and trial and error.

- Practice full-stack app development
- Build a working prototype in 2 weeks
- Apply the things i've learned in the bootcamp
- Learn and use the Tone.Js library
- Practice development skills like:

  - Making wireframes
  - Data model design
  - Write user stories
  - Use git version control

  ***

  ## User stories

  ***

  - As a visitor of Drum_Machine, I am able to sign up and log in as a user. I must register before I can save my compositions
  - The compositions I made can be saved by giving them a name
  - I can see compositions I've saved in the past and load them so I can listen to them again
  - I am able to play around with the sounds, adjust speed, volume and use Effects.
  - Planned: Share your compositions with other users,
  - Planned: Change Individual sounds.

The project is still in progess and I'm planning to improve and add features over time. Any suggestions or feedback?
Please let me know!

How i used Git.

- Write clear commit messages
- Work on the development branch

## Backend server repo

For the backend I used an Express server and user Sequelize to manage the Postgress database.

## Reflection

---

At the start of this project I just finished 9 weeks of intensive coding training at the Codaisseur bootcamp.

For my Drum_Machine I wanted to use some of the things that i've practiced during the Bootcamp. for example JS, React, Redux, Express etc..

My background lies in music and that is how i came up with the idea to create a step-sequencer. I found out about the Tone-Js library and wanted to use it with react and react-redux so users could login and save their creations. During the process of building my app I discovered that for many reasons Tone-Js and React don't work together very well. Fortunately there is very clear documentation on how to use [Tone-Js](https://tonejs.github.io/docs/14.7.58/index.html), Unfortunately with react, most of the examples don't work. I had to figure out my ways of working around these problems but got most issues fixed in the end.

In the future I hope to keep improving my Drum_Machine and make more features like adding FX.

The last three months have been a rollercoaster ride.
From working for one of the largest festival organizitions in the world to Covid-19 to losing my job to learning how to code!
Luckily I can say i'm glad this happened or else I probably wouldn't have started coding!
